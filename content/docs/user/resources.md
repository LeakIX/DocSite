viewing their information.

You can now select the type of resource you would like to add (e.g. DNS, IP, network, etc.). 
Once you have entered the information, click `Add`.

## Viewing resource information
Once you have added resources to your dashboard, you can view information about them, such as IP address, domain name, 
and other relevant details. To view this information, simply click on the resource you would like to view and 
the information will be displayed.
